notes on how to change/vary lgiht sources  + multiple light sources 

- light is located in the script.py
- draw_polygons is in draw.py
- get_lighting is in g_math

to have mutliple light sources:
change the get lighting function to take a list of lights 

to parse for human controlled light sources: 
change parser to recognize light (and thats basically it.)
	if c == "light":
		light takes in 6 args [x][y][z] directions, [color,color,color]

	to allow light to vary
	- to change color:
	vary [knob] [start_color] [end_color] [start_frame_num] [end_framenum]

	- to change position:
	just like normal.
