# Hanna Yang && Michelle Tang: Team RottenTangyBahanna

### Changes in scripting language
light takes in either 10 or 14 arguments:
light (name of light) (posiiotion args) (intensity args) (knob for position) (knob for color)
light (name of light) (position args) (intensity args) (knob for x position) (knob for y position) (knob for z position) (knob for red) (knob for green ) (knob for blue)

Naming conventions that must be followed:
* knob for position of light must have first 8 characters "location" 
* knob for hue of color must have first 5 characters "color"
* knob for x position of light must have first 4 characters "xcor", and same for y and z
* knob for red light must have first 3 characters "red" (for example, "red333" is a valid name, but "3red" is not.)
* to be safe, make sure you don't name any other knobs with these names (location, color, red, green, blue, xcor, ycor, zcor)

### List of features we plan to implement.
* Mesh
* Phong and Gouraud Shading
* Using vary to move the light position / color

### Possible image we plan to generate
